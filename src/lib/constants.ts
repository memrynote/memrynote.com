  {
    question: 'Is Memry free?',
    answer:
      'Memry offers a generous free tier for personal use on desktop. Core features like notes, tasks, journal, and inbox are completely free with no limits. Pro features like publishing to web, real-time collaboration, and mobile sync require a subscription.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Where is my data stored?',
    answer:
      'Your data lives in a "vault" folder on your computer that you choose. Notes are stored as plain Markdown files with YAML frontmatter for metadata. You can open them in any text editor.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my data secure?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Your data lives on your device — not our servers. When you use Pro features like sync, everything is encrypted end-to-end. Only you (and people you explicitly share with) can read your content. We literally cannot access it.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I sync between devices?',
    answer:
      "Absolutely! Since your vault is just a folder, you can use any sync service you prefer — Memry Sync, iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, Syncthing, or even Git. We don't lock you into our own sync solution."
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there a mobile app?',
    answer:
      "Desktop first (macOS, Windows, Linux) to nail the experience. Mobile apps for iOS and Android are targeting late 2026. In the meantime, your vault folder syncs with any cloud service you already use."
  },
  {
    question: 'What file format does Memry use?',
    answer:
      'Standard Markdown with YAML frontmatter for properties. Your notes are 100% portable and can be read by any Markdown-compatible app like Obsidian, iA Writer, or even VS Code.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I import from other apps?',
    answer:
      'Yes! We will support importing from Obsidian (direct vault), Notion (export), Roam Research, and plain Markdown folders. Your existing knowledge base can move with you.'
  },
  {
    question: 'When will Memry launch?',
    answer:
      "Early access opens Q2 2026, with a full public release targeting mid-2026. Waitlist members get first access and can help shape the product before launch."

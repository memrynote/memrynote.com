  {
    question: 'Is Memry free?',
    answer:
      'Memry offers a generous free tier for personal use on desktop. Core features like notes, tasks, journal, and inbox are completely free with no limits. Pro features like publishing to web, real-time collaboration, and mobile sync require a subscription.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Where is my data stored?',
    answer:
      'Your data lives in a "vault" folder on your computer that you choose. Notes are stored as plain Markdown files with YAML frontmatter for metadata. You can open them in any text editor.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my data secure?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely. Your data is stored locally on your device by default. When you use Pro features like sync or collaboration, all data is encrypted end-to-end (E2EE) — meaning only you and the people you share with can read it. Not even we can access your content.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I sync between devices?',
    answer:
      "Absolutely! Since your vault is just a folder, you can use any sync service you prefer — iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, Syncthing, or even Git. We don't lock you into our own sync solution."
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there a mobile app?',
    answer:
      "We're focusing on desktop first (macOS, Windows, Linux) to get the experience right. A mobile companion app is planned for after the initial launch."
  },
  {
    question: 'What file format does Memry use?',
    answer:
      'Standard Markdown with YAML frontmatter for properties. Your notes are 100% portable and can be read by any Markdown-compatible app like Obsidian, iA Writer, or even VS Code.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I import from other apps?',
    answer:
      'Yes! We support importing from Obsidian (direct vault), Notion (export), Roam Research, and plain Markdown folders. Your existing knowledge base can move with you.'
  },
  {
    question: 'When will Memry launch?',
    answer:
      "We're targeting a public release in mid-2026. Join the waitlist to get early access and help shape the product. Waitlist members will be the first to know when we launch."
